# Student-csv-Python-Project

<p>
The purpose of this project in python was to look at details about students. I looked to specify which students achieved which marks, what marks were achieved by the individual classes, and whether they had passed or not. As well as using python to create pivot tables. I wanted to use this dataset to look at overall performance to create insights that the school can use to determine which classes and students they need to focus on. This table contains data about students such as id, name, class, mark, gender.

<h2>Analysis of students marks</h2>

<p>These results provide me with the individual names and the marks that they achieved</p>
<p>The syntax data is named as such because thats what I named the table when importing the csv file from my local device. I used the double brackets in the syntax because I am getting data from multiple columns</p>
<p>This result creates an insight that can be used when considering which students may need additional support.</p>

<h2>Analysis of class marks</h2>

<p>These results provide me with marks for a particular class</p>
<p>This could be taken further by working out the average marks of each class. This is a change I might make if i were to do this again.</p>
<p>The Syntax is looking at the class column in the table and only returning results that are equal to four</p>
<p>This tells me how different classes are performing. A school may use this to look at the performance of their teachers</p>

<h2>Results Analysis</h2>

<p>I was tasked with manipulating the data to gain new insights. The purpose of this was to look at the student marks in relation to pass or fail criteria.</p>
<p>I added a new column to the table named 'passed'. The syntax looks at the marks column and says that if the value in that column is greater than 60 it will say true in the passed column if not it will return as false in the passewd column.</p>
<p>This gives a clear representation of the students progress and can be looked at by the school to track progress</p>

<h2>What I have learned</h2>
<p>This was my intro to python and ai have leaned how to write the code and apply it to certain scenarios</p>
